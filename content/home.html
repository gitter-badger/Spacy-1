<h1>Welcome to Spacy,</h1>
<p>an abstraction layer for sharing and developing vector space algorithms. It is motivated by the following ideas:</p>

<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>The main aim of this library is to facilitate sharing of algorithms. With Spacy researchers and users can develop and share algorithms without being tied to specific frameworks for the problem definition.</p>

<h3>Cleaner Code</h3>
<p>The separation of problem definition and solution algorithm helps in revealing the algorithmic structure in its implementation. Moreover it helps enforcing the separation of responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
<p>Type erasure is used for the definition of interfaces. Consequently duck-typing and value-semantics are supported.<br>Developing algorithms was never easier in C++.</p>
